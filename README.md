## Original project's overview

[Parabol](https://www.parabol.co) is an open-source application for running
the agile meetings Team Retrospective, Sprint Pokerâ„¢ and Team Check-in. You may try
a single-player demo of the latest implementation of Parabol (no login creation required) at: https://parabol.co/retro-demo

## Parabol Lightweight overview
Yet another fork in the pool of forks, but this one aims to work well on a Raspberry Pi 4 and lose some (hopefully more in the future) weight.
[DietPi](https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi) was my choice for OS to run and test on but anything (especially Debian based) should work (with enough patience and tinkering).
